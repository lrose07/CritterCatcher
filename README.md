Website to check what critters are available right now in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The plan is to grab the user's 
current time and location and display what fish, bugs, and sea creatures they are able to catch at this moment. Time 
travellers will have the option to choose a time, date, and hemisphere.

All data is from official Nintendo resources. Data obtained elsewhere (for sea creatures) will be cited as applicable.

Find out about the plz tool at https://github.com/m3brown/plz. It's saved me tons of time across all the projects I've 
pulled it into.

If you're better at Django than I am (you probably are), feel free to contribute.
